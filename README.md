    This project is a final project made by Istanbul Aydin University Electrical and Electronics Engineering Students for the COM473 INTERNET OF THINGS & INDUSTRY 4.0 course. Since it is a prototype project, it has shortcomings and security vulnerabilities. In this form, it cannot be used directly in a real project. However, it is a useful project in terms of paving the way for developers.

The implementation of an IoT based fire focused smart home system represents a pivotal advancement in addressing fire safety across diverse housing structures. This project aims to fill the safety gap, particularly in older homes, where the absence of modern fire alarm systems has led to tragic consequences. Our s olution provides an affordable, easy to integrate, and compact system that ensures widespread access to advanced fire detection and prevention measures. By leveraging sensors, Wi Fi connectivity, and a user friendly web control panel, our system offers rea l time monitoring and automated fan control. This innovation not only simplifies fire safety but also empowers users with manual control options. The project's core mission is to democratize advanced fire safety measures, contributing to safer living envir onments for all households, regardless of their age or construction.




## Built With

### Software Languages:
* C++
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Platforms:
* PlatformIO (Visual Studio Code)
* Proteus 

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### System

Basically, our microcontroller controls and process everything automatically. And we are saving our data with a database. For user interface, you can control your system with web control panel over the database.
